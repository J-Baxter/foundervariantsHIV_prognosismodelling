#### Mediation Analysis (Baron and Kenny (1986))
# This analysis uses Julián's Transmission pair dataset. 

# Import and format data


# Step 1: Regress the dependent variable on the independent variable to confirm that the
# independent variable is a significant predictor of the dependent variable.


# Step 2: Regress the mediator on the independent variable to confirm that the independent 
# variable is a significant predictor of the mediator. If the mediator is not associated with
# the independent variable, then it couldn’t possibly mediate anything.


# Step 3: Regress the dependent variable on both the mediator and independent variable to confirm 
# that a) the mediator is a significant predictor of the dependent variable, and b) the strength
# of the coefficient of the previously significant independent variable in Step #1 is now greatly 
# reduced, if not rendered nonsignificant
