# Leveraging mathematical models to better understand the influence of HIV multiple founder variants on disease progresssion.

The accompanying code explores several hypotheses that seek to explain the observed differences in disease progression between single and multiple founder infections.
We outline a null hypothesis, in which the observed assocation (Janes et al., 2015) is simply due to a greater probability that an individual recipient is infected by 
a 'high virulence' genotype. This model population is generated using population estimates of set point viral load from the Rakkai Community Cohort Study, Uganda
(Hollingsworth et al., 2019) and an implementation of a probabilistic model devised by Thompson et al., 2019.

We then propose and evaluate the following hypotheses:
1. Stage of infection in donor
2. Pre-adaptation of variants (HLA match/mis-match)
3. Within-host viral dynamic factors
