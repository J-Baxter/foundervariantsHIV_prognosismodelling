# RECONCILING FOUNDER VARIANT MULTIPLICITY OF HIV-1 INFECTION WITH THE RATE OF CD4+ DECLINE

Leveraging mathematical and statistical models to better understand the influence of HIV multiple founder variants on disease progresssion.


In the absence of effective antiretroviral therapy, almost all cases of HIV-1 infection will result in depletion of CD4+ T cells, such that the body can no longer formulate an adequate defence against opportunistic infection. However, the rate at which CD4+ T cells decline varies significantly across people living with HIV with unsuppressed viral replication, and the onset of AIDS can occur as little as two months to more than two decades post infection. While some studies report that infections that are initiated by multiple variants are associated with a faster CD4+ T cell decline, data are inconsistent and the mechanism through which this might occur is not understood. Here, we consider how variation in the number of variants initiating infection could explain variation in CD4+ T cell decline. Specifically, we use mathematical and statistical models that integrate clinical and epidemiological data to test the hypothesis that we should observe an association between greater genetic diversity at infection and a worse HIV prognosis.


Our multi-model framework encapsulates our present day characterisation of key relationships encompassing HIV transmission. We consider the statistical relationship between transmitter and recipient set point viral load (SpVL), the statistical relationship between recipient SpVL and rate of CD4+ T Cell decline; and the mechanistic relationship between transmitter SpVL and the probability that infection is initiated by multiple variants. We assume that the observed effect of multiple founder variants in the recipient on the rate of CD4 T Cell decline is mediated through SpVL.


./scripts/main will run the analyses. There is the option to export figures to file at the end of this script.
